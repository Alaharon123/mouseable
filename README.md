# Motivation

Mouseable is intended to replace a mouse or trackpad.

This program was inspired by
[Ultimate Hacking Keyboard Demo](https://youtu.be/4rjnkHqnA3s?t=20),  
[Windows built-in function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-mouse-keys-to-move-the-mouse-pointer-9e0c72c8-b882-7918-8e7b-391fd62adf33)
and [NeatMouse](https://github.com/neatdecisions/neatmouse).
