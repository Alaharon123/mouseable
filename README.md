# Mouseable

This program was inspired by
[Ultimate Hacking Keyboard Demo](https://youtu.be/4rjnkHqnA3s?t=20),  
[Windows built-in function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-mouse-keys-to-move-the-mouse-pointer-9e0c72c8-b882-7918-8e7b-391fd62adf33)
and [NeatMouse](https://github.com/neatdecisions/neatmouse).

## Reasons why to stop using mouse

1. **Productivity**

   When you use your mouse during programming? Does it necessary? Most tasks you
   do with the mouse are inefficient. Every single actions in IDE have
   shortcuts. If you become skilled at doing everything by keyboard, your
   productivity will increase a lot.

    * In IDE, use vim plugin and shortcuts.
    * In Browser,
      use [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en)
    * Other situations, use mouseable!


2. **Health**

   Using a mouse puts strain on your wrist.
