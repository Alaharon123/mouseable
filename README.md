# Motivation

This program was inspired by
[Ultimate Hacking Keyboard Demo](https://youtu.be/4rjnkHqnA3s?t=20),  
[Windows built-in function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-mouse-keys-to-move-the-mouse-pointer-9e0c72c8-b882-7918-8e7b-391fd62adf33)
and [NeatMouse](https://github.com/neatdecisions/neatmouse).

## Improvement

Unlike Windows built-in, you can customize every single shortcut. And unlike
NeatMouse, there are no stammering or lag, and there are more customizable
options.  
Also mouseable is written in pure Go, so it's easy to install and maintain.
