## Reasons why to stop using mouse

1. **Productivity**

   When you use your mouse during programming? Does it necessary? Most tasks you do with the mouse are
   inefficient. Every single actions in IDE have shortcuts. If you become skilled at doing everything by
   keyboard, your productivity will increase a lot.

    * In IDE, use vim plugin and shortcuts.
    * In Browser,
      use [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en)
    * Other situations, use mouseable!


2. **Health**

   Using a mouse puts strain on your wrist.
