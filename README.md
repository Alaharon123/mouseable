# Motivation
This program was inspired by
[Windows built-in function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-mouse-keys-to-move-the-mouse-pointer-9e0c72c8-b882-7918-8e7b-391fd62adf33)
and [NeatMouse](https://github.com/neatdecisions/neatmouse)

# Improvment

Unlike Windows built-in, you can customize every single shortcut. And unlike NeatMouse, there are no stammering or lag, and there are more customizable options.  
Also mouseable is written in pure Go, so it's easy to install and maintain.
